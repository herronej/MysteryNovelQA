But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow—Thursday—evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results—possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.”  Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?”  “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.”  “And the Conference is to be held?”  “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.”  Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.  “It is now a quarter to nine.”  “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully.  “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur—it may come in useful. Now for the details—the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?”  “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.”  “Eh bien?”  “Well, they started from Boulogne—but they never arrived.”  “What?”  “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.”  “And the bogus car?”  “Is still at large.”  Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?”  “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible—but nothing has been discovered!”  At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.  “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.”  The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew.  “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C——. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” "}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where was Poirot sitting", "id": "074c582e86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "in bed", "answer_start": 291}, {"text": "sitting up in bed", "answer_start": 280}, {"text": "bed", "answer_start": 1603}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who is the great Hercule Poirot", "id": "074c5afe86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "terror of evil-doers", "answer_start": 679}, {"text": "terror of evil", "answer_start": 679}, {"text": "terror", "answer_start": 679}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where was the author coming from?", "id": "074c5da686b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "a convalescent influenza patient", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "influenza patient", "answer_start": 107}, {"text": "a convalescent", "answer_start": 92}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What was Poirot sipping?", "id": "074c604e86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "a particularly noxious tisane", "answer_start": 384}, {"text": "noxious tisane", "answer_start": 399}, {"text": "tisane", "answer_start": 407}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who can't get a grip on you?", "id": "074c62e286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "own pet society detective", "answer_start": 899}, {"text": "society detective", "answer_start": 907}, {"text": "Poirot", "answer_start": 1639}, {"text": "Hercule", "answer_start": 885}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who is Roger Havering", "id": "074c66ca86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Second son of fifth Baron Windsor", "answer_start": 1695}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "How was Poirot's head muffled", "id": "074c681e86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "in a woollen shawl", "answer_start": 341}, {"text": "shawl", "answer_start": 354}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who stuck her head in the door", "id": "074c6a1286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Our landlady", "answer_start": 1251}, {"text": "landlady", "answer_start": 1255}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What was Poirot wearing", "id": "074c6be886b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}, {"question": "Which city was Poirot in", "id": "074c6c5686b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}], "context": "\"After all,” murmured Poirot, “it is possible that I shall not die this time.”  Coming from a convalescent influenza patient, I hailed the remark as showing a beneficial optimism. I myself had been the first sufferer from the disease. Poirot in his turn had gone down. He was now sitting up in bed, propped up with pillows, his head muffled in a woollen shawl, and was slowly sipping a particularly noxious tisane which I had prepared according to his directions. His eye rested with pleasure upon a neatly graduated row of medicine bottles which adorned the mantelpiece.  “Yes, yes,” my little friend continued. “Once more shall I be myself again, the great Hercule Poirot, the terror of evil-doers! Figure to yourself, mon ami, that I have a little paragraph to myself in Society Gossip. But yes! Here it is! ‘Go it—criminals—all out! Hercule Poirot—and believe me, girls, he’s some Hercules!—our own pet society detective can’t get a grip on you. ’Cause why? ’Cause he’s got la grippe himself’!”  I laughed.  “Good for you, Poirot. You are becoming quite a public character. And fortunately you haven’t missed anything of particular interest during this time.”  “That is true. The few cases I have had to decline did not fill me with any regret.”  Our landlady stuck her head in at the door.  “There’s a gentleman downstairs. Says he must see Monsieur Poirot or you, Captain. Seeing as he was in a great to-do—and with all that quite the gentleman—I brought up ’is card.”  She handed me the bit of pasteboard. “Mr. Roger Havering,” I read.  Poirot motioned with his head towards the bookcase, and I obediently pulled forth “Who’s Who.” Poirot took it from me and scanned the pages rapidly.  “Second son of fifth Baron Windsor. Married 1913 Zoe, fourth daughter of William Crabb.”  “H’m!” I said. “I rather fancy that’s the girl who used to act at the Frivolity—only she called herself Zoe Carrisbrook. I remember she married some young man about town just before the War.”  “Would it interest you, Hastings, to go down and hear what our visitor’s particular little trouble is?

You have his dossier?”  Lord Estair smiled. “I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.”  “Has he any relatives in England?”  “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.”  “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?”  “That point has not been overlooked.

The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road——”  “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot.  “Yes—but how did you know?”  “Oh, c’est évident! Continue!”  “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur——”  “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully.  “The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out—then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.”  “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver.  “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up—he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.”  “That is all you have to tell me?”  “Yes.”  “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?”  “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.”  “Yes?”  “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.” "}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who played her part and got out in the nick of time", "id": "074c892a86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "the housekeeper", "answer_start": 1409}, {"text": "housekeeper", "answer_start": 1413}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who was the housekeeper's conferderate", "id": "074c8cae86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "the black-bearded man", "answer_start": 273}, {"text": "bearded man", "answer_start": 283}, {"text": "black-bearded man", "answer_start": 277}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What was the housekeeper's part", "id": "074c906486b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "to provide an alibi", "answer_start": 373}, {"text": "provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering", "answer_start": 376}, {"text": "provide an alibi", "answer_start": 376}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What was Zoe Havering before her marriage", "id": "074c946086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "an actress", "answer_start": 697}, {"text": "actress", "answer_start": 700}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where was the revolver found", "id": "074c972686b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "at Ealing", "answer_start": 2108}, {"text": "Ealing", "answer_start": 2308}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who shot Mr. Pace", "id": "074c9a8286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "wife", "answer_start": 2457}, {"text": "Mrs. Havering", "answer_start": 3475}, {"text": "Zoe Havering", "answer_start": 1326}, {"text": "Zoe", "answer_start": 1326}, {"text": "housekeeper", "answer_start": 1413}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "When was Mr. Pace shot", "id": "074ca07c86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "after dinner", "answer_start": 2487}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who did Mr. Pace's fortune pass to", "id": "074ca21686b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "his murderers", "answer_start": 3366}, {"text": "Mrs. Havering", "answer_start": 3475}, {"text": "Roger Havering", "answer_start": 2164}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where was Mr. Pace born", "id": "074ca5e086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}, {"question": "How much money did the murderers get", "id": "074ca65886b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}], "context": "“I think not.

Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town.

He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.”  “What?”  The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face——”  “But by whom?”  “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.”  “Impossible!”  “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.”  “But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every one!”  “He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible—so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.”  “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?”  “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.”  “And the real Prime Minister?”  “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs. Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them—to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.  “When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?”  “When I began to work the right way—from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in—but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure!
