As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anaesthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.” "}, {"qas": [{"question": "On Saturday last, what train did Mr. Davenheim take?", "id": "136155b086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "train from Victoria to Chingside", "answer_start": 71}, {"text": "train", "answer_start": 71}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where is the Cedars situated?", "id": "136157c286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Chingside", "answer_start": 94}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who did Mr. Davenheim give various directions to?", "id": "1361593486b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "gardeners", "answer_start": 243}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who was Mr. Davenheim expecting on business?", "id": "13615a9286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Lowen", "answer_start": 489}], "is_impossible": "false"}], "context": "On Saturday last, as is his usual custom, Mr. Davenheim took the 12.40 train from Victoria to Chingside, where his palatial country place, The Cedars, is situated. After lunch, he strolled round the grounds, and gave various directions to the gardeners. Everybody agrees that his manner was absolutely normal and as usual. After tea he put his head into his wife’s boudoir, saying that he was going to stroll down to the village and post some letters. He added that he was expecting a Mr. Lowen, on business. If he should come before he himself returned, he was to be shown into the study and asked to wait. "}]}]}
