As I was saying, they motored down to Windsor, where the Prime Minister was granted an Audience. Early this morning, he returned to town, and it was on the way that the attempted assassination took place.”  “One moment, if you please. Who is this Captain Daniels? You have his dossier?”  Lord Estair smiled. “I thought you would ask me that. We do not know very much of him. He is of no particular family. He has served in the English Army, and is an extremely able secretary, being an exceptionally fine linguist. I believe he speaks seven languages. It is for that reason that the Prime Minister chose him to accompany him to France.”  “Has he any relatives in England?”  “Two aunts. A Mrs. Everard, who lives at Hampstead, and a Miss Daniels, who lives near Ascot.”  “Ascot? That is near to Windsor, is it not?”  “That point has not been overlooked. But it has led to nothing.”  “You regard the Capitaine Daniels, then, as above suspicion?”  A shade of bitterness crept into Lord Estair’s voice, as he replied:  “No, Monsieur Poirot. In these days, I should hesitate before I pronounced anyone above suspicion.”  “Très bien. Now I understand, milord, that the Prime Minister would, as a matter of course, be under vigilant police protection, which ought to render any assault upon him an impossibility?”  Lord Estair bowed his head. “That is so. The Prime Minister’s car was closely followed by another car containing detectives in plain clothes. Mr. MacAdam knew nothing of these precautions. He is personally a most fearless man, and would be inclined to sweep them away arbitrarily. But, naturally, the police make their own arrangements. In fact, the Premier’s chauffeur, O’Murphy, is a C.I.D. man.”  “O’Murphy? That is a name of Ireland, is it not so?”  “Yes, he is an Irishman.”  “From what part of Ireland?”  “County Clare, I believe.”  “Tiens! But proceed, milord.”  “The Premier started for London. The car was a closed one. He and Captain Daniels sat inside. The second car followed as usual. But, unluckily, for some unknown reason, the Prime Minister’s car deviated from the main road——”  “At a point where the road curves?” interrupted Poirot.  “Yes—but how did you know?”  “Oh, c’est évident! Continue!”  “For some unknown reason,” continued Lord Estair, “the Premier’s car left the main road. The police car, unaware of the deviation, continued to keep to the high road. At a short distance down the unfrequented lane, the Prime Minister’s car was suddenly held up by a band of masked men. The chauffeur——”  “That brave O’Murphy!” murmured Poirot thoughtfully.  “The chauffeur, momentarily taken aback, jammed on the brakes. The Prime Minister put his head out of the window. Instantly a shot rang out—then another. The first one grazed his cheek, the second, fortunately, went wide. The chauffeur, now realizing the danger, instantly forged straight ahead, scattering the band of men.”  “A near escape,” I ejaculated, with a shiver.  “Mr. MacAdam refused to make any fuss over the slight wound he had received. He declared it was only a scratch. He stopped at a local cottage hospital, where it was dressed and bound up—he did not, of course, reveal his identity. He then drove, as per schedule, straight to Charing Cross, where a special train for Dover was awaiting him, and, after a brief account of what had happened had been given to the anxious police by Captain Daniels, he duly departed for France. At Dover, he went on board the waiting destroyer. At Boulogne, as you know, the bogus car was waiting for him, carrying the Union Jack, and correct in every detail.”  “That is all you have to tell me?”  “Yes.”  “There is no other circumstance that you have omitted, milord?”  “Well, there is one rather peculiar thing.”  “Yes?”  “The Prime Minister’s car did not return home after leaving the Prime Minister at Charing Cross. The police were anxious to interview O’Murphy, so a search was instituted at once. The car was discovered standing outside a certain unsavoury little restaurant in Soho, which is well known as a meeting-place of German agents.” "}, {"qas": [{"question": "In the last night, the Prime Minister was accompanied by who?", "id": "1fce900686b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Captain Daniels", "answer_start": 2989}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where did they motor down to?", "id": "1fce91d286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Windsor", "answer_start": 1851}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "The Prime Minister's car was closely followed by another car containing who?", "id": "1fce938a86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "detectives in plain clothes", "answer_start": 2472}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where did the Premier start for?", "id": "1fce952e86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "London", "answer_start": 2948}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where did the Prime Minister put his head?", "id": "1fce96be86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "out of the window", "answer_start": 3714}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where was the Prime Minister born?", "id": "1fce987686b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}], "context": "“Here is news at last!

Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results—possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place.

He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.”  “Eh bien?”  “Well, they started from Boulogne—but they never arrived.”  “What?”  “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.”  “And the bogus car?”  “Is still at large.”  Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?”  “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible—but nothing has been discovered!”  At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.  “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.”  The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew.  “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C——. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” "}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Daniels put on the Prime Minister's face?", "id": "1fcda88086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "a pad of chloroform", "answer_start": 421}, {"text": "chloroform", "answer_start": 2647}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What does Daniels direct the driver to do", "id": "1fcdaba086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "turn to the right", "answer_start": 633}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What is the instantaneous anaesthetic", "id": "1fcdad6286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "ethylchloride", "answer_start": 973}, {"text": "chloroform", "answer_start": 2647}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who is the prime minister's secretary?", "id": "1fcdb05086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Captain Daniels", "answer_start": 510}, {"text": "Daniels", "answer_start": 3291}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What happened to the Prime Minister's face", "id": "1fcdb38486b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "bandaged up", "answer_start": 2039}, {"text": "face was bandaged up", "answer_start": 2030}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where did the police of this country hurry to", "id": "1fcdb64a86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "across the Channel", "answer_start": 2472}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What was the illusion", "id": "1fcdb80286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "the abduction has taken place in France", "answer_start": 2584}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who was Mrs. Everard", "id": "1fcdb9ce86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Frau Bertha Ebenthal", "answer_start": 3138}, {"text": "aunt", "answer_start": 3112}, {"text": "Ebenthal", "answer_start": 3150}, {"text": "Frau Bertha", "answer_start": 3138}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where did Frau Bertha Ebenthal and Daniels meet", "id": "1fcdbfa086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}, {"question": "How old is Daniels", "id": "1fcdc01886b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}], "context": "“For Heaven’s sake, tell me all about it,” I cried impatiently, as Poirot, Norman, and I motored back to London. “How in the world did they manage to smuggle him back to England?”  “There was no need to smuggle him back,” replied Poirot dryly. “The Prime Minister has never left England. He was kidnapped on his way from Windsor to London.”  “What?”  The Prime Minister was in his car, his secretary beside him. Suddenly a pad of chloroform is clapped on his face——”  “But by whom?”  “By the clever linguistic Captain Daniels. As soon as the Prime Minister is unconscious, Daniels picks up the speaking-tube, and directs O’Murphy to turn to the right, which the chauffeur, quite unsuspicious, does. A few yards down that unfrequented road, a large car is standing, apparently broken down. Its driver signals to O’Murphy to stop. O’Murphy slows up. The stranger approaches. Daniels leans out of the window, and, probably with the aid of an instantaneous anæsthetic, such as ethylchloride, the chloroform trick is repeated. In a few seconds, the two helpless men are dragged out and transferred to the other car, and a pair of substitutes take their places.”  “Impossible!”  “Pas du tout! Have you not seen music-hall turns imitating celebrities with marvellous accuracy? Nothing is easier than to personate a public character. The Prime Minister of England is far easier to understudy than Mr. John Smith of Clapham, say. As for O’Murphy’s ‘double,’ no one was going to take much notice of him until after the departure of the Prime Minister, and by then he would have made himself scarce. He drives straight from Charing Cross to the meeting-place of his friends. He goes in as O’Murphy, he emerges as some one quite different. O’Murphy has disappeared, leaving a conveniently suspicious trail behind him.”  “But the man who personated the Prime Minister was seen by every one!”  “He was not seen by anyone who knew him privately or intimately. And Daniels shielded him from contact with anyone as much as possible. Moreover, his face was bandaged up, and anything unusual in his manner would be put down to the fact that he was suffering from shock as a result of the attempt upon his life. Mr. MacAdam has a weak throat, and always spares his voice as much as possible before any great speech. The deception was perfectly easy to keep up as far as France. There it would be impracticable and impossible—so the Prime Minister disappears. The police of this country hurry across the Channel, and no one bothers to go into the details of the first attack. To sustain the illusion that the abduction has taken place in France, Daniels is gagged and chloroformed in a convincing manner.”  “And the man who has enacted the part of the Prime Minister?”  “Rids himself of his disguise. He and the bogus chauffeur may be arrested as suspicious characters, but no one will dream of suspecting their real part in the drama, and they will eventually be released for lack of evidence.”  “And the real Prime Minister?”  “He and O’Murphy were driven straight to the house of ‘Mrs. Everard,’ at Hampstead, Daniels’ so-called ‘aunt.’ In reality, she is Frau Bertha Ebenthal, and the police have been looking for her for some time. It is a valuable little present that I have made to them—to say nothing of Daniels! Ah, it was a clever plan, but he did not reckon on the cleverness of Hercule Poirot!” I think my friend might well be excused his moment of vanity.  “When did you first begin to suspect the truth of the matter?”  “When I began to work the right way—from within! I could not make that shooting affair fit in—but when I saw that the net result of it was that the Prime Minister went to France with his face bound up I began to comprehend! And when I visited all the cottage hospitals between Windsor and London, and found that no one answering to my description had had his face bound up and dressed that morning, I was sure!

There is something peculiarly elusive about that housekeeper, don’t you think so, Hastings? It struck me at once.”  “She played her part, I suppose, and then got out in the nick of time.”  “And what was her part?”  “Well, presumably to admit her confederate, the black-bearded man.”  “Oh, no, that was not her part! Her part was what you have just mentioned, to provide an alibi for Mrs. Havering at the moment the shot was fired. And no one will ever find her, mon ami, because she does not exist! ‘There’s no sech person,’ as your so great Shakespeare says.”  “It was Dickens,” I murmured, unable to suppress a smile. “But what do you mean, Poirot?”  “I mean that Zoe Havering was an actress before her marriage, that you and Japp only saw the housekeeper in a dark hall, a dim middle-aged figure in black with a faint subdued voice, and finally that neither you nor Japp, nor the local police whom the housekeeper fetched, ever saw Mrs. Middleton and her mistress at one and the same time. It was child’s play for that clever and daring woman. On the pretext of summoning her mistress, she runs upstairs, slips on a bright jumper and a hat with black curls attached which she jams down over the grey transformation. A few deft touches, and the make-up is removed, a slight dusting of rouge, and the brilliant Zoe Havering comes down with her clear ringing voice. Nobody looks particularly at the housekeeper. Why should they? There is nothing to connect her with the crime. She, too, has an alibi.”  “But the revolver that was found at Ealing? Mrs. Havering could not have placed it there?”  “No, that was Roger Havering’s job—but it was a mistake on their part. It put me on the right track. A man who has committed a murder with a revolver which he found on the spot would fling it away at once, he would not carry it up to London with him. No, the motive was clear, the criminals wished to focus the interest of the police on a spot far removed from Derbyshire they were anxious to get the police away as soon as possible from the vicinity of Hunter’s Lodge. Of course the revolver found at Ealing was not the one with which Mr. Pace was shot. Roger Havering discharged one shot from it, brought it up to London, went straight to his club to establish his alibi, then went quickly out to Ealing by the district, a matter of about twenty minutes only, placed the parcel where it was found and so back to town. That charming creature, his wife, quietly shoots Mr. Pace after dinner—you remember he was shot from behind? Another significant point, that!—reloads the revolver and puts it back in its place, and then starts off with her desperate little comedy.”  “It’s incredible,” I murmured, fascinated, “and yet——”  “And yet it is true. Bien sur, my friend, it is true. But to bring that precious pair to justice, that is another matter. Well, Japp must do what he can—I have written him fully—but I very much fear, Hastings, that we shall be obliged to leave them to Fate, or le bon Dieu, whichever you prefer.” “The wicked flourish like a green bay tree,” I reminded him.  “But at a price, Hastings, always at a price, croyez-moi!”  Poirot’s forebodings were confirmed. Japp, though convinced of the truth of his theory, was unable to get together the necessary evidence to ensure a conviction.  Mr. Pace’s huge fortune passed into the hands of his murderers. Nevertheless, Nemesis did overtake them, and when I read in the paper that the Hon. Roger and Mrs. Havering were amongst those killed in the crashing of the Air Mail to Paris I knew that Justice was satisfied.

He asked to see Mr. Pace, sir, and, seeing that he spoke the same way, I thought it was an American gentleman friend of Mr. Pace’s and I showed him into the gun-room, and then went to tell Mr. Pace. He wouldn’t give any name, which, of course, was a bit odd, now I come to think of it. I told Mr. Pace, and he seemed puzzled like, but he said to the mistress: ‘Excuse me, Zoe, while I just see what this fellow wants.’ He went off to the gun-room, and I went back to the kitchen, but after a while I heard loud voices, as if they were quarrelling, and I came out into the hall. At the same time, the mistress she comes out too, and just then there was a shot and then a dreadful silence. We both ran to the gun-room door, but it was locked and we had to go round to the window. It was open, and there inside was Mr. Pace, all shot and bleeding.”  “What became of the man?”  “He must have got away through the window, sir, before we got to it.”  “And then?”  “Mrs. Havering sent me to fetch the police. Five miles to walk it was. They came back with me, and the constable he stayed all night, and this morning the police gentleman from London arrived.”  “What was this man like who called to see Mr. Pace?”  The housekeeper reflected.  “He had a black beard, sir, and was about middle-aged, and had on a light overcoat. Beyond the fact that he spoke like an American I didn’t notice much about him.”  “I see. Now I wonder if I can see Mrs. Havering?”  “She’s upstairs, sir. Shall I tell her?”  “If you please. Tell her that Mr. Havering is outside with Inspector Japp, and that the gentleman he has brought back with him from London is anxious to speak to her as soon as possible.”  “Very good, sir.”  I was in a fever of impatience to get at all the facts. Japp had two or three hours’ start of me, and his anxiety to be gone made me keen to be close at his heels.  Mrs. Havering did not keep me waiting long. In a few minutes I heard a light step descending the stairs, and looked up to see a very handsome young woman coming towards me. She wore a flame-coloured jumper, that set off the slender boyishness of her figure. On her dark head was a little hat of flame-coloured leather. Even the present tragedy could not dim the vitality of her personality.  I introduced myself, and she nodded in quick comprehension.  “Of course I have often heard of you and your colleague, Monsieur Poirot. You have done some wonderful things together, haven’t you? It was very clever of my husband to get you so promptly. Now will you ask me questions? That is the easiest way, isn’t it, of getting to know all you want to about this dreadful affair?”  “Thank you, Mrs. Havering. Now what time was it that this man arrived?”  “It must have been just before nine o’clock. We had finished dinner, and were sitting over our coffee and cigarettes.”  “Your husband had already left for London?”  “Yes, he went up by the 6.15.”  “Did he go by car to the station, or did he walk?”  “Our own car isn’t down here.

The secret has been well guarded. Not a whisper of it reached the Press. But, now that the need for secrecy has gone by, I feel it is only just that England should know the debt it owes to my quaint little friend, whose marvellous brain so ably averted a great catastrophe.  One evening after dinner—I will not particularize the date; it suffices to say that it was at the time when “Peace by negotiation” was the parrot-cry of England’s enemies—my friend and I were sitting in his rooms. After being invalided out of the Army I had been given a recruiting job, and it had become my custom to drop in on Poirot in the evenings after dinner and talk with him of any cases of interest that he might have on hand.  I was attempting to discuss with him the sensational news of that day—no less than an attempted assassination of Mr. David MacAdam, England’s Prime Minister. The account in the papers had evidently been carefully censored. No details were given, save that the Prime Minister had had a marvellous escape, the bullet just grazing his cheek.  I considered that our police must have been shamefully careless for such an outrage to be possible. I could well understand that the German agents in England would be willing to risk much for such an achievement. “Fighting Mac,” as his own party had nicknamed him, had strenuously and unequivocally combated the Pacifist influence which was becoming so prevalent.  He was more than England’s Prime Minister—he was England; and to have removed him from his sphere of influence would have been a crushing and paralysing blow to Britain.  Poirot was busy mopping a grey suit with a minute sponge. Never was there a dandy such as Hercule Poirot. Neatness and order were his passion. Now, with the odour of benzine filling the air, he was quite unable to give me his full attention.  “In a little minute I am with you, my friend. I have all but finished. The spot of grease—he is not good—I remove him—so!” He waved his sponge.  I smiled as I lit another cigarette.  “Anything interesting on?” I inquired, after a minute or two. “I assist a—how do you call it?—‘charlady’ to find her husband. A difficult affair, needing the tact. For I have a little idea that when he is found he will not be pleased. What would you? For my part, I sympathize with him. He was a man of discrimination to lose himself.”  I laughed.  “At last! The spot of grease, he is gone! I am at your disposal.”  “I was asking you what you thought of this attempt to assassinate MacAdam?”  “Enfantillage!” replied Poirot promptly. “One can hardly take it seriously. To fire with the rifle—never does it succeed. It is a device of the past.”  “It was very near succeeding this time,” I reminded him.  Poirot shook his head impatiently. He was about to reply when the landlady thrust her head round the door and informed him that there were two gentlemen below who wanted to see him. "}]}]}
