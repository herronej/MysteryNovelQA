What have we for and against these two men? Take O’Murphy first. Against: that his conduct in leaving the main road was suspicious; that he is an Irishman from County Clare; that he has disappeared in a highly suggestive manner. For: that his promptness in restarting the car saved the Premier’s life; that he is a Scotland Yard man, and, obviously, from the post allotted to him, a trusted detective. Now for Daniels. There is not much against him, except the fact that nothing is known of his antecedents, and that he speaks too many languages for a good Englishman! (Pardon me, mon ami, but, as linguists, you are deplorable!) Now for him, we have the fact that he was found gagged, bound, and chloroformed—which does not look as though he had anything to do with the matter.”"}, {"qas": [{"question": "When is allied conference to be held", "id": "2a22e4c686b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "to-morrow—Thursday—evening", "answer_start": 231}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where is allied conference to be held", "id": "2a22e6b086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Versailles", "answer_start": 261}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who started and maintained the Pacifist propaganda", "id": "2a22e81886b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "the German agents", "answer_start": 483}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where did the abduction take place", "id": "2a22e9a886b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 2605}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Whom did the prime minister meet at Boulogne", "id": "2a22eb2486b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s", "answer_start": 1705}, {"text": "Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s", "answer_start": 1716}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where was the real bogus car", "id": "2a22edae86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "a side road", "answer_start": 1911}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Who was/were in that car", "id": "2a22ef2086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "the chauffeur", "answer_start": 1929}, {"text": "the A.D.C", "answer_start": 1947}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Where did they found the second car", "id": "2a22f1be86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "in an abandoned farm", "answer_start": 2899}, {"text": "farm", "answer_start": 2915}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "who was in the second car", "id": "2a22f42a86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "the secretary", "answer_start": 2842}, {"text": "Daniels", "answer_start": 2857}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "How much time left before conference", "id": "2a22f6a086b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Twenty-four hours", "answer_start": 1220}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What did Daniel remember", "id": "2a22f81c86b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind", "answer_start": 2959}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "When did the preminister leave Boulogne", "id": "2a22f9a286b211ebbe520242a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": "true"}], "context": "“For obvious reasons, no details have been given of when and where it is to take place. But, although it has been kept out of the newspapers, the date is, of course, widely known in diplomatic circles. The Conference is to be held to-morrow—Thursday—evening at Versailles. Now you perceive the terrible gravity of the situation. I will not conceal from you that the Prime Minister’s presence at the Conference is a vital necessity. The Pacifist propaganda, started and maintained by the German agents in our midst, has been very active. It is the universal opinion that the turning point of the Conference will be the strong personality of the Prime Minister. His absence may have the most serious results—possibly a premature and disastrous peace. And we have no one who can be sent in his place. He alone can represent England.”  Poirot’s face had grown very grave. “Then you regard the kidnapping of the Prime Minister as a direct attempt to prevent his being present at the Conference?”  “Most certainly I do. He was actually on his way to France at the time.”  “And the Conference is to be held?”  “At nine o’clock to-morrow night.”  Poirot drew an enormous watch from his pocket.  “It is now a quarter to nine.”  “Twenty-four hours,” said Mr. Dodge thoughtfully.  “And a quarter,” amended Poirot. “Do not forget the quarter, monsieur—it may come in useful. Now for the details—the abduction, did it take place in England or in France?”  “In France. Mr. MacAdam crossed to France this morning. He was to stay to-night as the guest of the Commander-in-Chief, proceeding to-morrow to Paris. He was conveyed across the Channel by destroyer. At Boulogne he was met by a car from General Headquarters and one of the Commander-in-Chief’s A.D.C.s.”  “Eh bien?”  “Well, they started from Boulogne—but they never arrived.”  “What?”  “Monsieur Poirot, it was a bogus car and a bogus A.D.C. The real car was found in a side road, with the chauffeur and the A.D.C. neatly gagged and bound.”  “And the bogus car?”  “Is still at large.”  Poirot made a gesture of impatience. “Incredible! Surely it cannot escape attention for long?”  “So we thought. It seemed merely a question of searching thoroughly. That part of France is under Military Law. We were convinced that the car could not go long unnoticed. The French police and our own Scotland Yard men, and the military are straining every nerve. It is, as you say, incredible—but nothing has been discovered!”  At that moment a tap came at the door, and a young officer entered with a heavily sealed envelope which he handed to Lord Estair.  “Just through from France, sir. I brought it on here, as you directed.”  The Minister tore it open eagerly, and uttered an exclamation. The officer withdrew.  “Here is news at last! This telegram has just been decoded. They have found the second car, also the secretary, Daniels, chloroformed, gagged, and bound, in an abandoned farm near C——. He remembers nothing, except something being pressed against his mouth and nose from behind, and struggling to free himself. The police are satisfied as to the genuineness of his statement.” "}]}]}
