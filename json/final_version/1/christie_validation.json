For the last three days the papers had been full of the strange disappearance of Mr. Davenheim, senior partner of Davenheim and Salmon, the well-known bankers and financiers. On Saturday last he had walked out of his house, and had never been seen since. I looked forward to extracting some interesting details from Japp.  “I should have thought,” I remarked, “that it would be almost impossible for anyone to ‘disappear’ nowadays.”"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does Mr. Davenheim have a passion for buying?", "id": "ea07ca10868d11ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "jewellery", "answer_start": 86}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "When did Mr. Davenheim take a trip to Buenos Ayres?", "id": "ea07caf6868d11ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "last autumn", "answer_start": 127}, {"text": "autumn", "answer_start": 132}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "At about what time was the telegraph handed to Poirot?", "id": "ea07cc0e868d11ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "eleven o’clock", "answer_start": 388}, {"text": "eleven", "answer_start": 388}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Since when have Mr. and Mrs. Davenheim occupied separate rooms?", "id": "ea07cd30868d11ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "last winter", "answer_start": 515}, {"text": "winter", "answer_start": 520}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "What month is it?", "id": "ea07cf1a868d11ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "June", "answer_start": 574}], "is_impossible": "false"}, {"question": "Hastings has no money in what bank?", "id": "ea07cfe2868d11ebbe520242a", "answers": [{"text": "Davenheim and Salmon", "answer_start": 648}], "is_impossible": "false"}], "context": "“One, the passion which has grown upon Mr. Davenheim in the last few years for buying jewellery.

At his request I opened it and read it out: “‘Husband and wife have occupied separate rooms since last winter.’” “Aha!” cried Poirot. “And now we are in mid June! All is solved!” I stared at him. “You have no moneys in the bank of Davenheim and Salmon, mon ami?”"}]}]}
