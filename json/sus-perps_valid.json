Make him all my excuses.” Roger Havering was a man of about forty, well set up and of smart appearance. His face, however, was haggard, and he was evidently labouring under great agitation. “Captain Hastings? You are Monsieur Poirot’s partner, I understand. It is imperative that he should come with me to Derbyshire to-day.” “I’m afraid that’s impossible,” I replied. “Poirot is ill in bed—influenza.” His face fell. “Dear me, that is a great blow to me.”", "qas": [{"question": "Who was well setup and of smart appearance?", "id": 0, "answers": [{"text": "Roger Havering", "answer_start": 129}]}, {"question": "Roger Havering was about what age?", "id": 0, "answers": [{"text": "forty", "answer_start": 163}]}, {"question": "What was haggard?", "id": 0, "answers": [{"text": "His face", "answer_start": 207}]}, {"question": "Under what was Roger Havering labouring?", "id": 0, "answers": [{"text": "great agitation", "answer_start": 276}]}]}, {"context": "From Mrs. Havering we elicited all the facts we could: “I engaged her about three weeks ago when Mrs. Emery, our former housekeeper, left.
